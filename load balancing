#To configure your load balancer and listener

1 Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

2 On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.

3 Choose Create Load Balancer.

4 For Application Load Balancer, choose Create.

5 For Name, enter a name for your load balancer. For example, my-alb.

6 For Scheme, an internet-facing load balancer routes requests from clients over the internet to targets. An internal load balancer routes requests to targets using private IP addresses.

7 For IP address type, choose ipv4 if your clients use IPv4 addresses to communicate with the load balancer, or choose dualstack if your clients use both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to communicate with the load balancer. If the load balancer is an internal load balancer, you must choose ipv4.

8 For Listeners, the default is a listener that accepts HTTP traffic on port 80. You can keep the default listener settings, modify the protocol, or modify the port. Choose Add to add another listener (for example, an HTTPS listener).

9 Select one subnet per zone to enable. If you enabled dual-stack mode for the load balancer, select subnets with associated IPv6 CIDR blocks. You can specify one of the following:

    Subnets from at least two Availability Zones

    Subnets from one or more Local Zones

    One Outpost subnet

10 (Optional) You can use Add-on services, AWS Global Accelerator to create an accelerator and associate the load balancer with the accelerator.

11 (Optional) For Tags, specify the key and value for each tag to add to your load balancer.

12 Choose Next: Configure Security Settings.

# Step 2: Configure security settings for an HTTPS listener 

To configure a certificate and security policy

1    For Select default certificate, do one of the following:

        If you created or imported a certificate using AWS Certificate Manager, select Choose a certificate from ACM, and then select the certificate from Certificate name.

        If you uploaded a certificate using IAM, select Choose a certificate from IAM, and then select the certificate from Certificate name.

2   For Security policy, we recommend that you keep the default security policy.

3  Choose Next: Configure Security Groups.

#Step 3: Configure a security group 

To configure a security group for your load balancer

1    Choose Create a new security group.

2   Enter a name and description for the security group, or keep the default name and description. This new security group contains a rule that allows traffic to the port that you selected for your load balancer on the Configure Load Balancer page.

3   Choose Next: Configure Routing.

# Step 4: Configure a target group

To configure your target group

1    For Target group, keep the default, New target group.

2    For Name, enter a name for the target group.

3    For Target type, select Instance to register targets by instance ID, IP to register IP addresses, and Lambda function to register a Lambda function.

4    (Optional) If the target type is Instance or IP, modify the port and protocol as needed.

5    (Optional) If the target type is Lambda function, enable health checks as needed.

6    For Health checks, keep the default health check settings.

7    Choose Next: Register Targets.

# Step 5: Configure targets for the target group 

To register targets by instance ID

1    For Instances, select one or more instances.

2    Enter the instance listener port, and then choose Add to registered.

3    When you have finished registering instances, choose Next: Review.

# Step 6: Create the load balancer

To create the load balancer

1    On the Review page, choose Create.

2    After the load balancer is created, choose Close.

3    (Optional) To define additional listener rules that forward requests based on a path pattern or a hostname, see Add a rule.
